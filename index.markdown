## About Tiny Defenders

Tiny Defenders is a fantasy strategy battle simulator game where you defend rather than attack. Defend your position from relentless waves of orc, goblin, and undead hordes. As you progress through the campaign, your roster of troops and abilities expands, giving you access to new defensive strategies.

* During the preparation phase, strategically place and upgrade units, construct and improve defenses, and manage resources
* When waves of enemies attack your base, adapt and react to their strategies by placing units in strategic locations and casting abilities to influence the battle, such as offensive meteor strikes or defensive slowing roots or rallying calls to friendly units
* Between waves, expand your base and unlock new technologies and upgrades by earning gold after completing each level, which includes new units, stronger defenses, and special abilities
* Follow the story of a group of survivors and their journey throughout the kingdom, protecting civilians and human lands from the onslaught of enemies and monsters
* Each level features multiple waves of enemies, with increasing difficulty, and special waves include boss battles and timed defense scenarios
* Experiment with different unit compositions and defensive strategies without the constraints of the campaign in sandbox mode

An early alpha playtest and demo will come soon!
