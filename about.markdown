### Overview

Tiny Defenders is an upcoming fantasy strategy battle simulator game developed by [Lumis Entertainment](https://lumisent.com/).

We are currently developing it as a solo developer with some help from artists and play testers. It's still in early stages so a lot could still change about the mechanics and direction of the game! Check out our early access coming soon to get invovled and help shape the game, we would love your feedback!
